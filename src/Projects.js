By enabling security analysis and debugging of closed-source compilers and FPGA-compliant programs, we address the critical issue of identifying Trojans and malware embedded in executable code. Our framework enhances security by providing insights into compiler behavior, facilitating the detection of hidden threats, and ensuring the integrity of sensitive information. Ultimately, this work promotes safer software development in high-stakes environments.",
